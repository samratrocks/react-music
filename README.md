## Music app in Howler.js

*public* hosts the static stuff and *src* hosts the React component and assets

If you wanna contribute read throught the source and then send me PRs.
If you wanna fork that's fine too.

I added animation on component mount. The animations are just proof of concepts so they can be replaced with your custom keyframes.

So it's basically done for now, as a prototype until I get a designer to make a good design for it.

Future Plans:
- Load music from your dropbox
- Add dropbox api
- Add authentication for dropbox
- Load users' dropbox files, scan for music
- Playlist will be added using JSON files, so that the script that makes the playlist will be different from the actual music app.
